## Why AI Clip Response ?

### Principles

Many AI tools are trying to wrap you into their ecosystem to extract your data. Instead, Clip Response is built on these principles:
1. Open source - fully transparent.
2. No data collection, outside of OpenAI of course (look through the code, or have GPT do it)
3. Simple, flexible, and general tool that you can incorporate into various workflows, and across different software systems or platforms.
4. Additional features coming - feel free to contribute!

### Why the Clipboard approach?

Sure, you could just use ChatGPT, but for some tasks AI Clip Response can save time and effort:

- Simple Chrome extension that is useful for repetitive tasks using an instruction like "Provide Constructive Feedback", "translate to French", "summarize to 1 main idea", etc.
- Set instructions once then apply them multiple times to any kind of text you copy to the clipboard
- Can be used across any window, not just within the Chrome browser, since all programs have access to the clipboard
- Works with any Chromium-based browser, including [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge) and [Brave](https://brave.com/).

**Get an OpenAI API Key**

The API key starts with "sk-" and has a total of 52 letters, numbers, and the hyphen. If you do not already have one, getting one takes just a minute or two:
1. Create an OpenAI account if you do not already have one.
2. Click your user icon in the upper right and then "View API Keys" in the dropdown menu, or [https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
3. If a key does not appear, click "Create a new secret key", name it, and copy it to a safe place. (Remember, keep this Key secret, do not share it with others or on the internet or people can use OpenAI at your expense)
